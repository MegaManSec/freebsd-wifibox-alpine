# This is a configuration file for udhcpd(8) with relatively sane
# defaults.  Consult https://udhcp.busybox.net/udhcpd.conf for more.
#
# The value of `interface` should match with the one defined in the
# interfaces.conf file: `interface` should be exactly the same,
# `router` should correspond to `address` and `subnet` is the
# `netmask`.  According to these settings below, a single IP address
# (10.0.0.2) is handed out, since only one is expected.  In the `opt
# dns` line, the `%%DNS%%` variable would be replaced with the IP
# addresses of the DNS servers as provided by the wireless network
# (wifibox extension).
#
# Change these only if this is not suitable.
