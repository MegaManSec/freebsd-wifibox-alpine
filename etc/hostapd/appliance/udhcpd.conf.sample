# This is a configuration file for udhcpd(8) with some basic defaults.
# Consult https://udhcp.busybox.net/udhcpd.conf for more.
#
# The value of `interface` should match with the one defined in the
# interfaces.conf file: `interface` should be exactly the same,
# `router` should correspond to `address` and `subnet` is the
# `netmask`.  According to these settings below, the IP addresses are
# handed out for the 192.168.0.0/24 network.
#
# Change these values as needed, they are here only for inspiration.
